# Plan

## General concept

React app that acts as an alarm and a way to waste a little bit of time 

When you first open it, you're prompted to enter a time for how long you want to waste

Collection of games/tools/thingies that keep you engaged while the timer ticks down

Alarm when the timer is finished

## Game ideas

### Minesweeper

Already done this, it's not hard to just copy paste that entire project and change some stuff

* Game sizes: Same as the other project, though make larger sizes change the size of the squares this time

### Sudoku

Seems like a fun programming challenge. I'm not sure how to generate grids, maybe randomly create a solved grid and randomly remove `n` values from it, higher difficulties = higher `n`?

As for input, it's probably easiest to have a load of text boxes, definitely look into what html element makes the most sense to use here

### Solitaire 

Already made an implementation of solitaire in Unity so I'm mostly aware of how the programming works

Largest issue here will probably be making cards draggable and snapping to piles

### Wordle

Obviously don't make it 1 word per day

Maybe let people change how big the word can be? guessing 4-10 characters might be pretty cool? https://dictionaryapi.dev/ this API seems useful for it

### Snake

Pretty simple, also did want to do this standalone anyways so may as well throw it in here. Only issue is reading inputs but i doubt that's hard
